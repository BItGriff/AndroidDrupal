/**
 *  An XmlRpcParser converts inbound XML-RPC messages to their Java counterparts through
 *  the use of a SAX compliant parser. This is an abstract class that is only concerned
 *  with the XML-RPC values contained in a message. Deriving classes supply a
 *  handleParsedValue() method that is called whenever an XML-RPC value has been parsed.
 *
 *  <p>If a class needs to be notified of additional parts of an XML-RPC message, the
 *  startElement() or endElement() methods are overridden and extended with checks for
 *  the appropriate element. This is the case with XmlRpcClient that wants to know if
 *  a fault element is present. Also, the XmlRpcServer wants to know the name of the
 *  method for which values are supplied.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Internally, the implementation uses pre-calculated hash values of the element names
 *  to allow for switch() constructs when comparing elements supplied by the SAX parser.</p>
